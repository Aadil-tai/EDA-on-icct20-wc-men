  <h2>üîç 2. Data Acquisition and Preparation üì¶</h2>
</div>

<h3>2.1 Importing necessary libraries</h3>

To begin the analysis, we will import essential libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. Pandas provides powerful tools for data manipulation and analysis, while Matplotlib allows us to create visualizations for better understanding and presentation of the data.

<h3>2.2 Loading the dataset</h3>

The next step is to load the ICC Men's T20 World Cup dataset into our project. We will utilize the four primary datasets: batting_card, bowling_card, details, and summary. These datasets contain comprehensive information about matches, players, batting and bowling statistics, and overall tournament summaries.

<h3>2.3 Data cleaning and preprocessing</h3>

Before we can analyze the data, it is crucial to perform data cleaning and preprocessing. This involves handling missing values, checking and adjusting data types, and addressing any inconsistencies or errors in the dataset. By ensuring data quality and consistency, we can obtain reliable and accurate results during our analysis.

Through these steps of data acquisition and preparation, we will have a well-prepared dataset ready for exploration and analysis. This process sets the foundation for our subsequent tasks, allowing us to extract meaningful insights from the ICC Men's T20 World Cup data.

  <h2>üìä 3. Exploratory Data Analysis üìä</h2>
</div>

<h3>3.1 Analysis of Batting and Bowling Statistics</h3>

By examining the batting and bowling statistics, we gained insights into player performances and identified key indicators of success. We calculated metrics such as runs scored, wickets taken, batting averages, bowling averages, strike rates, and economy rates. These statistics provided a comprehensive overview of player contributions and helped us understand the impact of individual performances on team outcomes. Specifically, we focused on analyzing the batting averages and visualizing them for players from different teams, including India (INDIA), Pakistan (PAK), England (ENG), and Afghanistan (AFG).

Through this analysis, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the batting performances within each team and make comparisons between teams. The resulting bar plot showcased the batting averages for players from each team, enabling us to observe and assess the performances of players within the ICC Men's T20 World Cup.

<h3>3.2 Visualization of Key Metrics</h3>

Visualizations provide a clear and intuitive way to understand the data. We can create various plots and charts to visualize key metrics such as wickets taken, runs conceded, and economy rate. Bar plots, line plots, and histograms can effectively represent these metrics, allowing us to identify patterns, trends, and outliers.

Using bar plots, we compared the performance of different teams in terms of wickets taken, runs conceded, and economy rate. This allowed for a clear comparison between teams and helped us identify variations in their bowling performances.
